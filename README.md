# scraper_analysis_corona
 Contains script to download and parse Bundestags-votes of the 19th legislative period and subsequently analyse those votes.
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
 
 The file "1-scraper.R" contains the script to download and extract voting information from the website www.abgeordnetenwatch.de. It iterates over bill information to extract the voting behaviour of German MPs in the 19th legislative period.
 
 The file "2-recode.R" processes the extracted data. The file "3-analysis.R" manually conducts a logit regression model to explain the decision of opposition parties to vote with or against the government in bills as a function of their ideological distance, their seat share as well as the time period (pre or post corona).
 
 The purpose of this data collection process and analysis is not to conduct a solid analysis, but to illustrate my skills in data collection.
